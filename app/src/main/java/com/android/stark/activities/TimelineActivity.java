                "Tony Stark comes out of the womb a genius. At age 4, he builds a circuit board. At age 6, he builds a V8 engine. By 17 years old, he graduates summa cum laude at MIT, and seems poised to take over Stark Industries whenever Howard feels ready to pass the buck. Unfortunately, after Howard's assassination, his partner Obadiah Stane takes over Stark Industries until Tony turns 21 and takes back his company. From there, it's a wild ride of building new technology and weapons for the American military for the next decade, while pissing off just about everyone in the scientific community. In 1999, Tony meets Ho Yinsen, Aldrich Killian, and Maya Hansen, and doesn't make a good impression on any of them. When viewers officially meet Tony Stark in 2008's Iron Man, he's at a weapons exhibition in Afghanistan to showcase \"The Jericho,\" a missile system that uses repulsor technology to increase effectiveness. On the way back from a successful presentation, Tony is kidnapped by a terrorist organization known as the Ten Rings that want him to build them their own Jericho missile.\n"

                "When Tony returns home, he realizes the error of his weapon-dealing ways and tells Obadiah that Stark Industries won't be making any more weapons technology. Obadiah's against the decision, and so is Colonel James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes, Tony's best friend and a true-blue military man. Unfortunately, Tony's new conscience comes with a cost; the board of Stark Industries ousts Tony on the basis that his new sense of empathy is just PTSD from his kidnapping. As it turns out, Obadiah's been playing both sides, both in terms of the Stark Industries board and the global weapons market. While pretending to serve as a father figure to Tony, he led the board's betrayal, and he's been selling Stark Industries tech to terrorist groups the whole time. Without actual control over Stark Industries and knowing that plenty of his tech is already out in the world, Tony upgrades his Iron Man suit to be sleeker and more colourful, and embarks on a quest to take down any terrorist groups using his weapons.\n"

Ivan uses an old blueprint of the arc reactor designed by his father and Howard Stark to build a replica of the super-battery. Six months later, Tony's turned his newfound superhero celebrity into an excuse to bring back the Stark Expo, as well as take credit for basically every good thing that's happened in America since Iron Man appeared. Not everybody's happy with a private citizen walking around like a human missile, though, and Tony's subpoenaed to appear in front of Congress to defend his right to bear the world's biggest armoury.\n"

Unfortunately, there's a bigger game at work: The Mandarin is just an actor playing a part designed by Aldrich Killian and Maya Hansen to give a narrative for their failed Extremis tests. After unravelling a conspiracy involving the vice president and Killian's plot to kill the president, Tony, Rhodey, and Pepper can defeat Killian and save the day. Tony undergoes heart surgery so he no longer needs the arc reactor to live, and seemingly retires from the hero business.\n");

Tony and Bruce crack the code on making it, and together, they create the AI dubbed Ultron. Determining that human beings are the problem with the Earth, Ultron tries to destroy the world with the help of the Strucker children, Wanda and Pietro. The Avengers show up to stop him, of course, but Wanda unleashes another one of her telepathic attacks against nearly the entire team, which leads to the Hulk going on a rampage that only Tony and his Hulkbuster armour can stop. After that, it all comes to a head in the fictional country of Sokovia, as Tony builds Vision, yet another artificial intelligence, using the Mind Stone and his J.A.R.V.I.S. program as a personality matrix. Together, the Avengers and Vision save the day, Ultron is blown up, and Tony quits the team at the end of the film.\n");

His generosity comes under a dark cloud, though, when he runs into Miriam, the mother of a man who died in Sokovia during the Ultron event. She reads Tony the riot act about his lack of responsibility, and when General Ross later shows up to suggest that the Avengers come under the official purview of the United Nations, Tony supports it. Steve Rogers, however, is very much against the Sokovia Accords, and the two men struggle to reconcile their differences.\n" +

Steve gathers a team to help Bucky evade capture, while Tony gets his team together, consisting of Black Widow, War Machine, Vision, Black Panther, and Spider-Man. A scuffle with Steve's team at the airport turns serious when War Machine is crippled by an errant blast from the Vision, which sends Tony into serious mode. He arrests Steve's team — minus Bucky and Cap, who've escaped — sends his team home, and pursues Cap and Bucky to Siberia alone. Zemo's plan comes to a head when Tony discovers that his parents died at Bucky's hand rather than in an automobile accident. After a brutal battle, Cap and Bucky escape, minus Cap's shield, but Cap gives Tony a cell phone with his number on it if a time comes that they ever need to reunite against a greater threat.\n");

Peter's increasingly desperate to get Tony's attention once the younger hero discovers that the Vulture, a weapons-dealing supervillain, has been selling high-tech weaponry he scavenged from the wreckage of the Chitauri invasion. Iron Man bails Spider-Man out twice, first with the help of a remote-controlled drone, and the second time in person, trying to convince Peter to slow down and be a local hero before looking to join the Avengers. After the second time, when Iron Man's intervention is the only thing that keeps the Staten Island ferry from sinking, Tony confiscates the high-tech suit he'd given Peter.\n" +

Peter surprisingly turns him down, and Tony, looking for a way to distract the reporters from an announcement that's suddenly no longer happening, proposes to Pepper Potts.\n");
